### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Sebastian, webdeveloper since 10 years (professionally) or 16 years (no friends as teenager).

I am specialized in PHP but all together good in learning stuff. 

I used to be a WordPress developer (and likely will pay my bills by working with WordPress for a while longer 2021-11-10) 
and started digging deep into Laravel since 2021-06 - so: I am a future Laravel developer.
(I read a piece about a person whose job title was "future astronat" - I like that positive outlook).

Currently based in Berlin/Germany, maybe moving to Freiburg/Germany. 

Self-employed, open for freelance jobs or getting employeed (making my parents proud).
Best: part-time and remote. 

My GitHub profile is a bit unorganized. Most of my client work is very unique to there needs or I am not allowed to share. 

German: native,
English: fluent,
Klingon: sorry, not that type of nerd, 
The Langugage of Emotions: future expert
