### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Sebastian, webdeveloper since 10 years (professionally) or 16 years (... introverted kid builds websites to find friends).

I am specialized in PHP but first of all a enthusiastic learner.

I used to be a WordPress developer but decided that I would like to learn modern programming.
Currently mostly working with Symfony while still supporting some clients on WordPress. 

Freshly relocated to Leipzig/Germany.

Currently employed at [MentalStark](https://mentalstark.online) and keeping long time clients happy.

My GitHub profile is a bit unorganized. Most of my client work is very unique to there needs or I am not allowed to share. 

German: native,
English: fluent,
Klingon: sorry, not that type of nerd, 
The Langugage of Emotions: future expert
